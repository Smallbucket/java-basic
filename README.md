## Java 集合框架

什么是集合框架?摘录了一段官方的说明：

A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following:

* Interfaces: These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.
* Implementations: These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.
* Algorithms: These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface. In essence, algorithms are reusable functionality.
